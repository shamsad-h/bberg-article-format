# Bloomberg article formatter

This is a script written in Python that uses regular expressions to automatically format articles sent from the Bloomberg terminal.

The script runs on a file called "bloomberg_article.txt" and outputs the formatted file as "bloomberg_article_formatted.txt"

The "bloomberg_article.txt" can contain as many articles as required.

When including multiple articles, seperate each with **five + signs**.

E.g.:

Article 1

+++++

Article 2
